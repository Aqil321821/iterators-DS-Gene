# Well-Known Symbols:
There are some well-known symbols, also called 'built-in symbols' that are used by JavaScript engines
to provide certain language features and are shared by all built-in objects. For example,
Symbol.iterator is utilized to iterate over items in arrays, strings, or even to define your own iterator
function

You can actually see all of the built-in symbols by running the following code:
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Symbol));
